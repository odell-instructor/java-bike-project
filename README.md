We make a range of Road Bikes and Mountain Bikes. We have a default frame color for each of our bike styles. Below will be the listed colors and pricing. Before we sell one of our bikes, we perform a series of steps. These steps can be added
to the customer receipt upon completion of an order. We will also provide those below. Our wheels come in two styles; Wide and normal. Each wheel type has a tire and tube and are specific to each type. We will however offer a white tire as a
special-order item for either style.

We also provide some custom options that are in addition to our base model bicycles. A limited-edition golden frame, leather seat and leather grips. These options come with an additional cost, which will be below. For our Road Bikes, we offer 2 styles: Touring & Vintage. For our Mountain Bikes, we offer 2 styles:
Downhill and Cross Country. Only our Mountain Bike line uses wide wheels and tires.

Bike Frame colors: Black, Red, Blue, Green & Chrome

- Touring is $499.99 with a default color of Blue
- Vintage is $299.99 with a default color of Red
- Downhill is $699.99 with a default color of Black
- Cross Country is $599.99 with a default color of Green

There are steps performed for each bike prior to a sale.
- Airing the tires
- Test Riding the bike to ensure assembly has been done correctly.
- Washing the frame

Each frame has a stamped serial number on it. Each serial number has a prefix and starting number per model. For this prototype application, we will generate these serial numbers with a small inventory system.
- Touring prefix: TB901 and a starting number of 951357
- Vintage prefix: VB801 and a starting number of 753159
- Downhill prefix: DB505 and a starting number of 852654
- Cross Country prefix: MB605 and a starting number of 258456

The custom options below will cost in addition to the base price of the bicycle.
- Gold Frame for $299.99
- Leather Seat for $98.99
- Leather Grips for $49.99
- White Tires for $29.99 each.

We will also offer some basic accessories for our bicycles at a separate cost. Since they will be offered as a separate cost, a customer can just purchase accessories without buying a bicycle.
Accessories include: helmets, gloves, basket, bell, tire pump & lights.

We will provide a collection of bicycles to choose from that include the default color. This will allow us to have serial numbers already generated and any custom bikes will need to know the most recent serial number so no duplicates are
created.
